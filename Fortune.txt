Some days you are a pigeon, some days you are a statue. Today, bring an umbrella
Your reality check is about to bounce
Wise people never try to get even. Wise people get odder
Two days from now, tomorrow will be yesterday
Your inferiority complex isn't good enough. Try harder
When chosen for jury duty, tell the judge "fortune cookie says guilty!”
Stop eating now. Food poisoning is no fun
You are cleverly disguised as a responsible adult
Tomorrow at breakfast, listen carefully: do what rice krispies tell you to
Drive like hell, you will get there
People who eat this fortune cookie get a lousy dessert
It's okay to look at the past and future. Just don’t stare
Wise people need either good manners or fast reflexes
This soup is a secret family recipe made from toad. Hope you like it!
You will soon have an out of money experience
Probability of being seen directly proportional to stupidity of act
He who dies with most toys, still dies
People who sleep on laurels get thorns in their backside
Practice safe eating. Always use condiments
People who do their haircut after rice wine will be buzzed
